\section{Introduction}

%This section gives a short overview of your assignment.

The aim of this report is to evaluate the requirements, design and testing of a distributed computing application. The task was to create distributed, multi-player implementation of the Yahtzee Game. 

Yahtzee is a game where players take turns to roll 5 dice over the course of 13 rounds. There are 13 scoring options in Yahtzee. A roll of dice is evaluated against these thirteen options of which one or many may qualify, but only one may be chosen after the end of the round; the points for this score are calculated. The score may not be chosen again in future rounds.
