\subsection{Requirement 6 - Game must exit cleanly when all players finish} 

\subsubsection{Expectation} 
The definition of a termination protocol whereby clients understand when there is no more input expected. 

\subsubsection{Implementation}

\begin{description}
	\item[c.d.c.a.api.ConnectionProtocol] Contains the definitions of the constants which can be appended to a message to determine the action required by the client. This implementation permits for connection termination and input request from the client.
	
	\item[c.d.c.a.core.Player] Acts upon the event received denoting the game is finished and forwards the connection termination string down the player's connection stream.
	
	\item[c.d.c.a.multiplayer.Lobby] Terminates the game once all players are disconnected by changing the state. The current approach is susceptible to a race condition which in some times can lead to the pre-emptive termination of still existing connections. 
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Demonstrating log output} 

No logs as this is demonstrated fully in 7.
