\subsection{Requirement 1 - Must follow client server approach} 
		
\subsubsection{Expectation} 
The presence of a separated application entry point for the Client and Server. 

\subsubsection{Implementation}

{\begin{description}
	\item [com.dominiccobo.cs3004.assignment.client.Client] Client side code implementation provides connectivity and basic protocol understanding for connectivity to Server which houses game logic. 
	
	\item [com.dominiccobo.cs3004.assignment.multiplayer.Lobby] Serves as the entry point and centre-point for handling of all connected clients, setting up an instance of a game for each connection while places are available and ultimately starting the game when everyone has joined and is ready.
