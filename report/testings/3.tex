\subsection{Requirement 3 - Each player must play the same round before proceeding.} 

\subsubsection{Expectation} 
Presence of code restricting players from progressing when they do not hold a turn, sleeping their associated thread and waking it as required.

\subsubsection{Implementation}

\begin{description}
	\item[c.d.c.a.core.Yahtzee]  Implements a basic iterator, responsible for iterating through a list of rounds. This iterator waits based on the injected instance of a TurnMediator which it queries to understand whether to proceed with playing the round or sleep and wait until notified for its turn.
	
	\item[c.d.c.a.core.TurnMediator] Provides an abstraction of the logic which oversees players progression through the rounds.
	
	\item[c.d.c.a.multiplayer.Lobby] Defines logic which does not allow any player to start until all players are ready.
	
	\item[c.d.c.a.multiplayer.OrderlyQueuedMultiPlayerTurnMediator] Provides an implementation of the Turn Mediator which acts based on threads and an understanding of the registered game instances.
