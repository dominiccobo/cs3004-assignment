\subsection{Requirement 4 - Player scores and winners must be shared on finishing} 

\subsubsection{Expectation} 
Presence of logic to understand when each player is finished, when all players are finished and their associated scores.

\subsubsection{Implementation}

\begin{description}
	\item[c.d.c.a.multiplayer.Lobby] Collects an understanding on which players finish, their scoreboard and ultimately when all finish publishes their so the winners can be calculated and shared using the \textit{GameFinishedEvent}.
	
	\item[c.d.c.a.core.Player] Publishes when a player has finished all their rounds and listens for when the game is finished, calculating each score and sending it over the connected input and output streams.
	
\end{description}
