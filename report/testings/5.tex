\subsection{Requirement 5 - A minimum of three players must be allowed to play} 

\subsubsection{Expectation} 
Definition of maximum players, count of players joined and restriction of new joiners.

\subsubsection{Implementation}

\begin{description}
	\item[c.d.c.a.multiplayer.Lobby] Implements the \textit{LobbyLifecycleEvents} interface which defines the expected events within a Lobby. Defines a constant establishing the maximum number of players. 
	
	Understands number of players connected by keeping track of these set and the players connected by keeping a map of their identifier and their name; this approach is highly susceptible to a race condition and should most likely implement double validating logic to ensure that on connection 1 can connect a time.
