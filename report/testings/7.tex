\subsubsection{Expectation} 
 Logging of outcome of logic and player interaction to console

\subsubsection{Implementation}

\begin{description}
	\item[All classes and packages] All classes that contain some form of executed logic pertinent to a player will log its action to the console. 
	
	All input and output streams sent to the player are also, by default, displayed in the player's console so they can act on them.
	
	\item[Test cases] Verify the functioning of the game logic.
\end{description}
